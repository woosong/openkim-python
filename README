Python interface to Open KIM API

This requires KIM_DIR set, and also KIM_DYNAMIC=yes.
Also, for installation using setup.py, needs a version
of numpy after 1.2 (does not work) but before 1.6.1 (does). 
We are not sure when the necessary changes were made.


Neighbor locator and iterator are supported by default locator/iterator functions that can be used,
with the python test delivering the actual neighbor list in the right structure.

'make install_kim' inserts the interface into existing KIM directory.
