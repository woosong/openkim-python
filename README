Python interface to Open KIM API

This requires KIM_DIR set, and also KIM_DYNAMIC=yes.

Neighbor locator and iterator are supported by default locator/iterator functions that can be used,
with the python test delivering the actual neighbor list in the right structure.

'make install_kim' inserts the interface into existing KIM directory.
